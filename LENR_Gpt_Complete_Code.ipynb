This technique enables metallic systems to be reacted with a thermodynamically well-defined highly active reference phase (gaseous hydrogen). Two factors are particularly important. (1) The reaction between gaseous hydrogen and metallic surfaces can be allowed to proceed for any length of time. This means that even processes wit...  \n","1  116 Fig. 1.
